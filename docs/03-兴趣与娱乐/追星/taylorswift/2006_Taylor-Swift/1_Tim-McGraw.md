He said the way my blue eyes shined,
他说我的蓝眼睛闪耀着光芒

Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
那天晚上，把佐治亚州的星星都比下去了

I said, "That's a lie."
我说：“那是谎言。”

Just a boy in a Chevy truck,
只是一个开着雪佛兰卡车的男孩

That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
他有个习惯，就是经常被卡住

On backroads at night
在夜晚的小路上

And I was right there beside him all summer long
整个夏天，我都在他身边

And then the time we woke up to find that summer'd gone
然后有一天我们醒来，发现夏天已经过去了

But when you think Tim McGraw
但是当你想起蒂姆·麦格劳

I hope you think my favorite song
我希望你能想起我最喜欢的歌

The one we danced to all night long
我们整晚都在跳的那首歌

The moon like a spotlight on the lake
月亮像是湖面上的聚光灯

When you think happiness
当你想到幸福

I hope you think that little black dress
我希望你能想到那件小黑裙

Think of my head on your chest
想到我把头枕在你的胸口

And my old faded blue jeans
还有我那条旧旧的褪色蓝色牛仔裤

When you think Tim McGraw
当你想起蒂姆·麦格劳

I hope you think of me
我希望你能想起我

September saw a month of tears
九月，眼泪满满

And thankin' God that you weren't here
感谢上帝你不在这里

To see me like that
不然你会看到我那样（泪流）

But in a box beneath my bed
但是在我床底下的一个盒子里

Is a letter that you never read
有一封你从未读过的信

From three summers back
来自三年前的那个夏天

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
很难不觉得这一切都有点苦涩

And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
回想起那一切，很高兴能相信

When you think Tim McGraw
当你想起蒂姆·麦格劳

I hope you think my favorite song
我希望你能想起我最喜欢的歌

The one we danced to all night long

The moon like a spotlight on the lake
月亮像是湖面上的聚光灯

When you think happiness

I hope you think that little black dress

Think of my head on your chest

And my old faded blue jeans
还有我那条旧旧的褪色蓝色牛仔裤

When you think Tim McGraw

I hope you think of me
我希望你能想起我

And I'm back for the first time since then
我自那以后第一次回来

I'm standin' on your street
我站在你的街上

And there's a letter left on your doorstep
你的门口有一封信

And the first thing that you'll read
你读到的第一件事

Is when you think Tim McGraw
就是当你想起蒂姆·麦格劳

I hope you think my favorite song

Someday you'll turn your radio on
总有一天你会打开收音机

I hope it takes you back to that place
